# OutWait
OutWait is a platform to manage waiting times in facilities like doctor offices or public departments. Queues of waiting clients can be managed through a android interface and the clients can register using a private code to look up their remaining waiting time on their mobile phone and get notified when they are next.

This project was created for the computer science lecture "PSE" at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology.
